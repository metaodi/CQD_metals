I'll be sure to note that in my log. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement.

# Carbon quantum dots (CQD) and their applications ([Lim et al., 2015](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2014/cs/c4cs00269e?page=search))
Carbon nanoparticles (Xu et al., 2004), easy to obtain that emit fluorescence in different wavelength (can be tuned)

Quasi-spherical nanoparticles comprising amorphous to nanocrystalline cores with predominantly graphitic or turbostratic carbon (sp2carbon) or graphene and graphene oxide sheets fused by diamond-like sp3 hybridised carbon insertions

**Interesting review by Lim et al., 2015**

Named by Sun et al (2006), who focused in synthesis

Synthesis routes:
- Top down
- Bottom up

## Features

- Oxidised CQDs contain considerable amounts of carboxyl moieties at their surface.

- High [Carboxyles]:
    - Highly soluble in water
    - Suitable chemically reactive groups for further functionalization  --> modifies solubility
    - Suitable for surface passivation with various organic, polymeric, inorganic or biological materials to CQDs. --> enhances fluorescence (as per modification of physical properties) | what about surface passivation with heavy metals in a natural ? Should perform analysis of affinity

- Excellent physico-chemical and photochemical stability (non-photobleaching or non-photoblinking)

- Benign chemical composition

- Depending on the synthetic route, the oxygen content in the oxidised CQDs ranges from 5 to 50% (weight)

## Fluorescence

Two mechanisms for fluorescence
- bandgap transitions caused by conjugated p-domains
- more intricate origins associated with surface defects in CQDs.

**Tunable fluorescence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

- Defects in surface CQDs can be neutralised upon surface passivation with organic or polymeric materials (not emissive), such as poly(propionyl ethyleneimine-co-ethyleneimine) (PPEI-EI)

- This surface passivation enhances fluorescence, covering a broad range of the visible region and extends it into the near-infrared (NIR) (!!!!!!!!!!)

Relationship fluoresce - size of the dot (Risvi et al 2010??? can't find reference)

- Fluorescence is affected by ph
  - intensity decreases above or below ph=7
  - intensity decreases ~3% when ph taken from 5 -> 9
  - intensity/ph relation varies according to != synthetic route

*up-conversion fluorescence*:  optical phenomenon wherein the fluorescence emission wavelength is shorter than the used excitation wavelength,

- CQD present not only down-conversion fluorescence (conventional) but also up-conversion, which is still discussed but could be great for:
    - thick samples
    - differentiation of auto-fluorescence

## Synthesis

### Top-down synthetic route
By breaking down larger carbon structures (nanodiamonds, graphite, carbon nanotubes, carbon soot, activated carbon, graphite oxide) by arc discharge, laser ablation
or electrochemical oxidation

a one-step electrochemical approach utilising low-cost and readily available graphite as a carbon source was recently proposed by Ming et al.

### Bottom-up synthetic route
Bottom-up approaches synthesise CQDs from molecular precursors such as citrate, carbohydrates and polymerâ€“silica nanocomposites through combustion/
thermal treatments, and supported synthetic and microwave
synthetic routes

Bourlinos et al. described an easy, one-step thermal decomposition method of obtaining fluorescent CQDs from ammonium citrate

**Zhu and co-workers showed that CQDs are readily formed by heating a solution of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and saccharide in a 500 W microwave oven for 2 to 10 min**

[Table 1](https://github.com/thessaly/CQD_metals/blob/master/table1.png) sums up green synthesis methods

## Surface passivation and functionalization

> Surfaces of CQDs possess high sensitivity to contaminants in their environment, such that their properties are easily affected by tiny levels of contaminants.

**note:** amazing for trace pollutants
